# Snakeball

This is a school project: a game made with Unity in which a ball is chased by a snake. The player has to find all the gold coins to get to the next level and can also collect bonuses, while the snake is growing longer and becoming faster.

This project was made with Pierre PERRIER-RIDET (pierre.perrierridet@gmail.com).

You can try the game by launching snakeball.exe from the Build/ folder. The packages required are listed in [this file](ReleaseNotes.txt) (in French). The instructions for the game can be found [here](Tutoriel.pdf) (in French).
